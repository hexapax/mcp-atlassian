# Upstream Issue Triage Log

Tracking document for systematic triage of upstream `sooperset/mcp-atlassian` issues.
Focus: All open issues (bugs and features, any service).

**Test spaces:** MCPTEST (Confluence Cloud), JTEST (Jira Cloud — general), JSMTEST (JSM — requires separate license)
**Skill:** `.claude/skills/upstream-triage/`

## Status Key

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| PENDING | Not yet examined |
| RESOLVED | Feature exists / bug no longer reproduces — upstream PR with regression test |
| CONFIRMED | Feature missing or bug still reproduces — branch with failing test, fix in Phase 2 |
| CANNOT_REPRODUCE | Insufficient info to reproduce |
| COMPLEX_DEFER | Too entangled or architectural, deferred to our issue tracker |
| OUT_OF_SCOPE | Pure infrastructure, third-party plugins, documentation, or client-side |

## Difficulty Key

| Rating | Meaning | Examples |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Easy | 1-2 file change, <20 lines | Add expand param, fix filter logic, expose existing method |
| Medium | 3-5 files, needs tests, <100 lines | New error handling, model changes, new tool |
| Hard | Architectural change, >100 lines | New preprocessing pipeline, multi-instance support |
